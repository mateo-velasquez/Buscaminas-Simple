## 🧠 Project Description

This is a basic implementation of the classic **Minesweeper** game using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

Key features include:

- A **dynamic board** that expands or contracts based on the selected difficulty.
- Allows the user to **enter a custom name**.
- A **restart button** with a spin animation.
- A **timer** that tracks the duration of the game.
- A custom **recursive function** designed to automatically reveal adjacent empty cells — one of the most fun and challenging parts of the development.
